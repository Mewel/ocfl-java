# OCFL Java API

`ocfl-java-api` defines the interface for interacting with an [OCFL](https://ocfl.io/) repository. It currently has one
implementation, [ocfl-java-core](https://github.com/pwinckles/ocfl-java-core). An alternate implementation could be an
HTTP client that integrates with an HTTP based OCFL implementation.

See [ocfl-java-filesystem](https://github.com/pwinckles/ocfl-java-filesystem) for usage details.
